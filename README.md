# vulnerability-scan-3-13-3-14
Full CI-CD deployment

### Steps to do!

git clone <repository ssh>
npm init
npm install serverless
npm install serverless-offline –save-dev
serverless deploy #to deploy serverless application
serverless remove #to remove serverless application on lambda
.gitignore (add node_modules/ and .serverless)


**Create workflow “.github/workflows/main.yml” in repo**

name: CICD for Serverless Application
run-name: ${{ github.actor }} is doing CICD for serverless application

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, "*" ]

jobs:
  pre-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "The job is automatically triggered by a ${{ github.event_name }} event."

**- after this code in main.yml - the github action will have to be done for deploy.**

_________________________

next have to add the block below for main.yml

  install-dependencies:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: pre-deploy
    steps:
      - name: Check out repository code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run installation of dependencies commands
        run: npm install

**I will have to ensure that the workflow is deploy ok, as format for .yml is very important**
_________________________

FYI only

The --save-dev option in the npm install command is used to save packages under the devDependencies object in your package.json file. This is useful when you have some packages that are needed only for development and testing purposes123.

**Now install Jest for unit testing**

npm install jest –save-dev

- told to change package.json 

original msg when Jest is downloaded:
````
 "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
````

to change to :
````
 "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
````

- told to change the index.test.js message (to be the same as index.js)
original code is:
````
        {
          message: "Go Serverless v3.0! Your function executed successfully!"
        },
````

to change to :

````
        {
          message: "Your function executed successfully!",
        },
````





- serverless.yml to add code below to the functions, same line as api: 
chen-string is my parameter store variable name, anyone can refer to this variable
````
environment:
    ACCESS_INFORMATION: 'enchen' 
    ACCESS_KEY: ${ssm:chen-string}
````

access information: is a manually created 
but the ACCESS_KEY: is for getting the variable from aws parameter store



- index.js add the variable the access key line only to the message  (did not add access_information as I don't need it now, it's an example only)

```
        {
          message: "Your function executed successfully!",
          access_key: process.env.ACCESS_KEY
        },
```
